    tldr: "We find evidence that US manufacturing sectors experience US import tariffs either as supply-side or demand-side shocks, depending on the location of the sector and the affected products in the US production network. Using local projections in a panel of US manufacturing sectors, we find that US import tariffs —in particular including the 2018-19 tariff hikes— led to sectoral output contractions via two different channels: (1) Tariff increases act as negative supply shocks for sectors that use the affected goods as input in production and thus face rising input costs; (2) Tariff increases act as negative demand shocks for sectors whose customers experience the tariff increase as a negative supply shock and reduce their production."

    title: "Evaluating the Debt-at-Risk Framework: Evidence from Euro Area Countries",
    authors: "Krzysztof Bańkowski, Pierre M. Rouillard",
    tldr: "This paper examines how current economic, financial, and political conditions shape the entire conditional distribution of future public debt in Euro area countries. Additionally, we provide the first out-of-sample evaluation of the IMF’s newly developed Debt-at-Risk framework. We find that its predictive performance surpasses alternative models at short horizons, especially for extreme outcomes. These findings support the use of probabilistic risk-based frameworks in guiding fiscal surveillance and informing policy makers to rising debt vulnerabilities.",
