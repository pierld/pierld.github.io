## Deploying onto GitHub Pages

1. Fork or clone this repo and push to your own repository at `[your-github-username].github.io`.

2. In your repository settings, ensure the repository name matches `[your-github-username].github.io` if you want it to be your main GitHub Pages site.

3. Push your changes to the main branch.

4. Go to the GitHub page for your repository and go to `Settings` then `Pages`. If you set Source to be `GitHub Actions`, it should suggest you a build script for Next.js.

5. Commit the build script and see things building.

Your site should now be live at `https://[your-github-username].github.io/`.

## Deploying to your own domain

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/) from the creators of Next.js.

1. Create a [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/signup) if you haven't already
2. Push your code to a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket)
3. Import your repository on Vercel
4. Vercel will automatically detect Next.js and configure the build settings
5. Click "Deploy"
